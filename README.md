# BPR-GAN
This repository contains the files needed for creating a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic event logs. For that purpose, we used the [Activities of daily living of several individuals](https://data.4tu.nl/articles/Activities_of_daily_living_of_several_individuals/12674873) event log for the training of our GAN.
