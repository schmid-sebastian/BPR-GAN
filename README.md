# BPR-GAN
This repository contains the files needed for creating a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic event logs in order to achieve Business Process Reengineering (BPR). For that purpose, we used the [Activities of daily living of several individuals](https://data.4tu.nl/articles/Activities_of_daily_living_of_several_individuals/12674873) event log for the training of our GAN.

# Findings
While the GAN at its current stage might not be able to fully support BPR, its potential remains. With more granular and bigger datasets, the incremental nature of our process improvements might change to a more radical one.
